Uses [`bevy_fps_controller`][9] for Source Engine inspired movement with [`Air Strafing/Bunny Hopping`][8]
Air Strafing works by changing direction mid air, using synced mouse and strafe keys (`A`,`D`), while not using `W` and `S`.

### Controls

- Move - `WASD`
- Jump - `SPACE`/`MWheel Down` (Can also hold space to keep jumping)
- Toggle Auto-Bhop - `SHIFT`+`SPACE`
- Reset to Checkpoint - `R`
- Reset Level - `SHIFT`+`R`
- Pause - `ESC`

For the best experience running natively is recommended.

### Dev controls/console

- Console - ``` ` ```

The console has a bunch of commands:

- `pause` - toggle pause/resume
- `debug` - toggle debug config (e.g. physics debug)
- `level {level}` - go to level
- `noclip` - fly/noclip
- `fps` - toggle fps counter

### Known Issues

- Mouse capture release/in-game pause on itch.io/wasm/fullscreen requires pressing esacpe twice.
- Janky Surf/Speed Boost.
- [Edge falloff detection/Crouch issue][7].
- MouseWheel jump scroll event not kept around long enough to trigger proper jump sometimes (might fix this one soon for hardcore bhoppers that need/want it).
- shadows cutting off after a certain distance.

###  Release Notes

 - The `Run` time is basically the sum of the best segments. Failed attempts don't count. Could be improved/differentiated in the future.


### Things that were cut due to time constraints but might be added in the future

- Multiplayer
- Multiple types of boosts
- dynamic and more particle/sound fx
- Highscores
- Settings Page
